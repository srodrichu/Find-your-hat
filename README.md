# Find-your-hat

As part of the Codecademy front-end developer course we were instructed to make a game that takes in a two-dimensional array with randomly generated field which contains holes (the obstacle), the hat (the goal) and the starting user location, which is set to [0][0].
The aim of the game is to navigate through the field to reach the hat without falling off the map or into any holes.
